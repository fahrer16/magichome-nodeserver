I built this on ISY version 5.0.10 and polyglot version 0.0.7 from 
https://github.com/UniversalDevicesInc/Polyglot

This is my first attempt at building a node server for the ISY using Polyglot and I borrowed heavily from Einstein42's lifx-nodeserver (https://github.com/Einstein42/lifx-nodeserver) and beville's flux_led project (https://github.com/beville/flux_led)
